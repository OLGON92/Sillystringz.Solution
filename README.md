# _SillystringzFactory.Solution_

#### By _**Oscar Gonzalez**_

#### _This is an app that lets you create an engineer or a machine; as well as a list for either of the two. You can then assign an engineer to a specific machine and vice versa. Each machine can have a list of engineers that are assigned to said machine, and a list of machines that have assigned specific engineers._

## Description

_This is my eleventh project for Epicodus that is meant to show off my understanding of basic web applications with a database whilst utilizing C#; it is also meant to show my understanding of many-to-many relationships. Here is a [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Sillystringz.Solution) to the repository on GitHub._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* _Follow the steps below_

#### Installing .NET & MySQL
* _First, you will need to install .NET 6 if it isn't already on your machine_
* _Here is a link where you can download for your Mac, Windows, or Linux based machince: [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)_
* _Look in your downloads and open the file_
* _Follow the installation intructions_
* _To confirm the the installation was a success: on your command line in your terminal type "dotnet --version"_
* _Then you will need to install MySQL. Follow the instructions in here[link](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql) to do so._

#### Configuring appsettings.json
* _Clone the repository using this link: [link](https://github.com/OLGON92/Sillystringz.Solution)_
* _Navigate to the 'Sillystringz.Solution' directory on your computer_
* _Open it with your favorite text editor (Visual Studio Code is one I highly reccomend)_
* _From here you will go to the "Factory" Directory_
* _Create a new file called "appsettings.json_
* _In the appsettings.json file you will add the following code below_
* _*Please note that your username and password is dependent on what you have set up in your MySQLWorkbench.*_
* _*Also, do not include the brackets []*_
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=oscar_gonzalez;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}
```



#### To add a migration, start a development server, and view the project in the browser follow the steps below:_
* _Navigate to 'SillystringzFactory.Solution' in your command line_
* _From there navigate to 'Factory'_
* _Run the command "dotnet build"_
* _Then run the command "dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0"_
* _Then you will run the command "dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design -v 6.0.0"_
* _Now you will need to create a migration; run the command "dotnet ef migrations add Initial"_
* _Anytime you make a change to any of the models, you will have to enter this command "dotnet ef migrations add [ChangeInMigration]" . Please note that the brackets don't need to be there, and words in brackets are an example._
* _After verifying that the changes are correct enter "dotnet ef database update". If you would like to remove a migration, enter "dotnet ef migrations remove"_
* _Then run the command "dotnet watch run"_
* _It should then open the development environment in your preferred web browser automatically_
* _If it does not open automatically, then open your preferred web browser, copy/paste this http://localhost:5000 into your web browser, and you should be able to use the app after that_

#### To view your schema in MySQL Workbench follow the steps below
* _Open MySQLWorkbench, and click on the "Local instance 3306" box_
* _From here you will click on the "Schemas" tab on the left_
* _On the left you should see the name of the schema you created in the appsettings.json file_
